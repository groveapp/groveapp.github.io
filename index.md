## Welcome to Grove

Despite the lightning speeds of modern technology, communication between people and our leaders is still often shallow and inefficient. We’re creating a tool where citizens and our leaders can learn more about each others’ thoughts and actions, so leaders can understand how to best serve their constituents, and so citizens can regain confidence that our leaders are representing us well.

### Why

There's no shortage of evidence that institutional decision-making is often decoupled from the public. On many issues, there are significant discrepancies between the beliefs and values of citizens and the policies that our institutions implemement. This phenomenon might be contributing significantly to the deep deficit of trust in government, and the recent decline of democracy globally. We don't want this to happen, so we launched an endeavor to use digital technology to revamp out social technology.

### What

We're building a platform where citizens can contribute their viewpoints on the issues they care about. We're going to place this infomation alongside a list of relevant actions that leaders have taken, so that everyone can see if there's a stark discrepancy between citizen opinion and leader actions. We're also leveraging this platform as a civil forum to generate new ideas, reach compromises, and forge movements, so that everyday citizens with busy lives are empowered to help change the world.
